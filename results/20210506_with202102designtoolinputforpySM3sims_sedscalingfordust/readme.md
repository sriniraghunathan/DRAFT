## PySM sims have high-\ell problems. Check this [link] (https://github.com/CMB-S4/s4mapbasedsims/issues/18)

# Temporary fix here 20210506_with202102designtoolinputforpySM3sims_sedscalingfordust:
* Using SED scaling for galactic dust from 278 GHz. 
* Code also has the option to perform power-law fit but power-law fit for TT (dust) looks weird.
* Nothing has been done for sync. But that is almost negligible and does not cause any significant biases.
